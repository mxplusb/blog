First, let's start this off with a short introduction. My name is Mike Lloyd, and I am currently a Senior Solutions Architect with [Pivotal Software, Inc](https://pivotal.io/). I would like to first start off by stating this blog does not, in any way, represent [Dell Technologies'](https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/index.htm) (or any of their holdings) opinions , their business practices, their IP, and any content contained in this blog, regardless of whichever post, is of my own opinion and of my own devices. You will likely see many posts regarding integrations with products derived from their IP.

**Disclaimer: You may or may not stumble upon various instances of profane language. I feel being able to speak my mind honestly (which is usually just stream of consciousness) is important.**

As far as what you'll see on this blog, you'll see integrations for enterprise software, video games (*__yay!__*), prolly some data analysis, and whatever else floats my boat. If you saw the tag line, you'll notice that I really just like to fiddle around with little bits of code, here and there. I have a terrible tendency to not finish large personal projects because I get distracted, so I really like to work on small little things, just so I can keep my own sanity by feeling good about something I was able to finish.

Hence why I like to fiddle with little bits of code and why I don't really like to do large projects in my personal life. Ironically, I have a great sense of commitment for work. I do love pop culture, and you will see many pop culture references across my posts.

Happy Reading!
